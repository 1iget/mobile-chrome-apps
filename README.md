You can run your [Chrome Apps](http://developer.chrome.com/apps) on Android and iOS via the [`cca` command-line tool](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps).  This tool wraps your application's web code with a native Android/iOS application shell, creating a hybrid app, and allowing you to distribute via Google Play and the Apple App Store.  You can learn more from our [FAQ](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/faq.md).

The Chrome Apps for Mobile project is built on top of [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org), the open source mobile development framework for building mobile apps with native capabilities using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Chrome App Developer Tool (New!)

The [Chrome App Developer Tool](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-app-developer-tool/) enables a fast edit/refresh cycle when developing your mobile Chrome App.  It can also be used alongside the [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg?hl=en) IDE to support rapid, SDK-less development!

## Additional resources

* There are a few special considerations that you should keep in mind when developing with Cordova; we've listed them in the [considerations section](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/CordovaConsiderations.md).

* To view which Chrome APIs are supported on mobile, visit the [API Status](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/APIStatus.md) page.
