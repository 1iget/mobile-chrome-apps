## Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile

The Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile is a standalone app that allows you to download and run a Chrome App without setting up the `cca` development toolchain. Use this tool when you want to quickly preview an existing Chrome App (already packaged as a CRX) on your Android or iOS device.

The Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile is currently in a pre-alpha release. To try it out, view the [Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile project](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-app-harness#chrome-app-harness) for installation and usage instructions.
