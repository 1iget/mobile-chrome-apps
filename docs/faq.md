# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions:
### Do mobile Chrome Apps run in Chrome?

No. Mobile Chrome Apps are first-class native apps that run independently from Chrome. They are built with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), which means apps leverage UIWebView on iOS, and either [Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org) or the system [WebView](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html) on Android.


### What Web APIs are supported?

Core web features vary by the underlying WebView (e.g. iOS 6 vs iOS 7 vs Android vs Crosswalk).


### What Chrome APIs are supported?

Chrome API support is tracked within [APIStatus.md](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/APIStatus.md).


### Is NaCL / PNaCL supported?

No. However, you can still compile and use native code by writing a custom Cordova Plugin.


### Why use CCA rather than Cordova?

- A more oppinionated workflow
- Background page & lifecycle events
- More reasons: [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21684414/reasons-for-porting-a-cordova-app-to-a-mobile-chrome-app/)


### Do CCA plugins work in vanilla Cordova projects?

Yes.


### Can I use Cordova plugins within CCA apps?
Yes. `cca` [forwards commands](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21886407/chrome-cordova-app-plugin-access/) to `cordova`, so the following will work:

    cca plugin add [PLUGIN_ID or GIT_URL or LOCAL_PATH]
    
One caveat though - when using `cca push` and the Chrome App Developer Tool, only plugins built into the tool will be avaiable.


### How do I update my version of the CCA tool?

    npm install -g cca


### Something doesn't work. How can I ask for help?

File a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/issues).


### Why does Hello World produce >20mb APK?

By default, `cca` uses a bundled WebView ([Crosswalk](https://crosswalk-project.org)), rather than the system webview.


### Why use the Crosswalk WebView?

Crosswalk provides much better performance and a newer web runtime than the stock Android WebView.


### Whatâ€™s the memory/file size impact of bundling CrossWalk?

Crosswalk adds about 30 MB to the .apk size and has a fixed memory overhead of about 30MB (_as reported by the RSS column of `ps`_).


### Can I opt not to use the Crosswalk webview?

You can opt-out by adding `"webview": "system"` to your `manifest.mobile.json`.


### Do CCA Apps violate CSP?

CCA does not enforce CSP, but we may look at adding it at some point in the future. [Track the issue](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/issues/73).


## How-to's:

### Is it possible to create multiple windows in CCA apps?

No. However, if you have a use-case for wanting to, we'd love to hear about it :).


### How do I use Polymer with CCA apps?

* __Android with Crosswalk__: Polymer runs without the need for polyfills.
* __Android without Crosswalk__: Polymer works only on KitKat and requres its polyfills.
* __iOS 6/7/8__: Polymer works and requires its polyfills.

For Polymer to work with CSP enabled, you must use the [volcanize](http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/concatenating-web-components.html) tool to concatenate your imports.


### How to sync data between Mobile and Desktop chrome app (e.g. with Drive)?

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22885267/sync-data-between-android-app-and-chrome-app-using-google-drive/

Neither `chrome.storage.sync` nor `chrome.syncFileSystem` are supported within CCA. However, you can use `chrome.identity` to obtain a Google auth-token, and use that with the [Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/quickstart-js) to sync files.


### How to set status bar color on iOS?

See SO answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21673797/set-status-bar-color-using-chrome-mobile-apps/


## Workflow Questions:

### What files should I check into source control?

Generally, it's best to check in only files that you've edited, and not those generated by `cca`. In addition, it's helpful to use a script or README instructions that will create the Cordova workspace based on what you have checked in. E.g.:

    cca create GeneratedProject --link-to src
    
### When should I use CCA vs Chrome Dev Editor?

The [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg) has the ability to deploy Chrome Apps to the [Chrome App Developer Tool](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-app-developer-tool/). However, it does not have the ability to create .apk or .ipa files for upload to the Play Store / App Store. Using them interchangeably on the same source directory should work just fine :).


### Can I use Xcode / Eclipse with CCA projects?

Using Xcode and Eclipse is often really useful when developing your own Cordova plugins. Use the Xcode / Eclipse project files within the `platforms/ios` and `platforms/android` directories respectively. BUT REMEMBER! When making edits to files within these IDEs, you will be editing __copies__ of the files that are clobbered when running `cca` commands.
